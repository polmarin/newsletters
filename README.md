# Newsletter Layout Development
For some months I had the opportunity to work as a freelance for Ideas Agitadas. My job consisted in developing newsletter layouts based on previously created Illustrator designs. Here are some of them but not all.
More specifically, I was in charge of newsletters from La Vanguardia and Mundo Deportivo. I used HTML and CSS (occasionally JS) to create the final product which would be sent to all subscribers from these two big press brands.
