# Newsletter Layout Development
For some months I had the opportunity to work as a freelance for Ideas Agitadas. My job consisted in developing newsletter layouts based on previously created Adobe Illustrator designs. Here are some of them but not all.

More specifically, I was in charge of newsletters from **La Vanguardia** and **Mundo Deportivo**. I used HTML and CSS (occasionally JS) to create the final product which would be sent to all subscribers from these two big press brands.

Each directory in this repository contains a different newsletter. Most of them contain two versions: a Catalan and a Spanish one. If you're willing to see the code of any of them, just choose the folder, then the language folder, and finally open the index.html. If you want to see the final result, download the files and do the same in your computer (when opening the index.html, you'd now see the delivered solution).
